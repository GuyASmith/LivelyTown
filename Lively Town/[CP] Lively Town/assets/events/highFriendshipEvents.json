		// HARVEY - STRETCH: Harvey's 10 and 14 heart events are romantic and domestic respectively, it would need a new event
		// PENNY - STRETCH: figure out what to substitute for Penny's 14 heart redecoration (and probably don't give players items)
		// MARU - STRETCH: Maru's event is really romantic, needs a good substitute that isn't just stargazing again
